## Repository Rules and Regulations

### Introduction

This document outlines the rules and regulations for interacting with this repository. These rules are designed to maintain the integrity of our codebase and ensure a smooth development process.

### Branch Functioning

All Branches are named following the [better-branch](https://github.com/Everduin94/better-commits?tab=readme-ov-file#-better-branch) syntax. You can read the documentation and install [better-commits](https://github.com/Everduin94/better-commits?tab=readme-ov-file#) to access this and ease your creation of branches by typing `better-branch` in the terminal.

For better referencing, branches can be prefixed with the project name. Example: `lynkr_landing`

### Workflow

1. **Accessing project Kanban space**
   - The project is organized in a public a [kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/LHA-Labs/projects/1).
   - All pending tasks are to be listed in the backlog and associated to the corresponding project.
   - If you have no assigned task, you can self assign a "ready" task and move it to the "In progress" column.

2. **Creating Branches**
   After being assigned a task from the board,
   - Before starting any work, checkout to the feature branch using the `better-branch` command.
   - Your branch name should look like `docs/#5-setup-repository-readme` (to reference a documentation branch.)

3. **Working on Tasks**
   - Developers should work on their assigned task feature branches.
   - All commits must be done using "better-commits".
   - Commit messages should be descriptive of the changes done in the corresponding files.
   - Keeping commits as small as possible will ease you writting your commit message.
   - Commits should be atomic, with each commit representing a single code change, facilitating review.

4. **Pull Requests**
   - After completing a task, submit a pull request to the develop branch.
   - Request a review from a relevant maintainer.
   - Post a message in the group with a link to the pull request to campaign for review.
   - Keep your PR's as small as possible enable swift and concise reviews.
   - For beginners, wait for PR validation before moving on to the next task to ensure learning from feedback.
   - Only branches named using the better-branch syntax will be validated during PR's

5. **Validation and Merging**
   - The code owner need to be prompt in the updating of requested changes.
   - Only maintainers have the right to validate and merge PRs into develop and main branches.
   - Once merged, the owner can move unto the next task.

### Setup

#### Windows / Linux

1. Clone the repository:
  ```git clone https://github.com/LHA-Labs/lha-labs.git```

2. Change to the project directory:
  ```cd lha-labs```

3. Install dependencies:
  ```npm install```

4. Create a `.env` file by following the .env.<application>.skeleton template.

5. Start an application using Nx:
  ```npx nx serve <app name>``` Replace <app name> with the name of your specific application.
